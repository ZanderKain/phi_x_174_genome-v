This is the source code for my project, which is about parsing a bacteriophage genome and doing some entry level bioinformatics analysis.

To use this code, use the "main.py" function and run it. All other text files in the folder are mainly output files generated from the main script. A secondary Python file, "toolkit.py," houses all the functions being called in the main file to separate and keep the code clean. 

This file can be used with other fasta sequences to perform the same analysis, but for the scope of my project, the fasta sequence used for the targeted bacteriophage is included in the folder.
